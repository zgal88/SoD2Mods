**Mod Manager** - Allows for the import, rearranging, updating, and removing of .pak mod files, download-able from the **Mods** folder, or from the **[State of Decay 2 Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/emhxg5d "State of Decay 2 Modding Discord")**

**Automated QuickBMS** - This is a simple wrapper around the QuickBMS program, and a custom .bms script made by Kai Heilos, that allows for unpacking the SoD2 game assets, from any installation spot on your computer. It has two options:  
- Full-Auto - This will automate everything for you, and dump the assets into a folder on your desktop. Be sure to have ~25 to  30GB of space available.  
- Choose Output Folder - This allows you to choose where the unpacked assets will be placed.
